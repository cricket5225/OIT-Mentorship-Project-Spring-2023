# OIT-Mentorship-Project-Spring-2023
Over the course of our 8-week mentorship, Dave and I developed an API that allows users to record a restaurant’s name and address, then add reviews to each restaurant. As each review is added, a sentiment analysis is run using the ML.NET framework, and the sentiment- whether positive or negative- is added to a total count per restaurant. The results are then displayed as a static map, using the Google Maps Geocoding API to retrieve latitude and longitude, and the Google Maps API to place the restaurant on the map. Each restaurant displays as an icon with the total number of reviews it has received, and color is determined by whether the restaurant has majority-positive or majority-negative reviews. Aside from a static map, the Restaurant Review API can also return data in the GeoJSON format, providing flexibility in potential use by developers.
